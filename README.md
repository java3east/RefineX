# RefineX
RefineX is a Simulation program for Lua scripts. It is created and maintained by [Refined Solution](https://discord.gg/7VzUry4UQt). We are aiming to make this program able to simulate resources in various games like FiveM. It comes with a build-in Lua library to help you test your resources.<br>
**This Program is still in development and is not yet able to simulate any resource.**
